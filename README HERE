Designing Your Schema
● Think about how you want to design the tables in your relational database, based
on the API and any other additional data you might be storing, such as user login
information.
● What will the primary and foreign keys be? Which tables will relate to each other?
What kind of relationships will they have?
● Draw out how you’d like the associations to work in the Crow’s Foot notation we
taught you. Refer to this video for a refresher.
● Once you decided on your columns and their data types, tables and their
relationships, primary and foreign keys, and constraints that your schema will
have, upload a text file containing your schema design or draw it out, take a
picture, and upload that.
